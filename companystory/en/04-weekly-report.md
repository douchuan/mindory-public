# Inside Big Tech: How to Write a Weekly Report

A weekly report is an important communication tool.  
An excellent weekly report answers only one core question:

> What **measurable value** did you create for the team?

## Speak With Data

Managers don’t reward effort — they reward results.

Bad examples:
- Fixed some bugs  
- Optimized performance  
- Helped teammates  
- Improved system stability  

These statements mean almost nothing.

Good examples:
- Fixed **7 production bugs**, including 2 P1 issues affecting the payment pipeline  
- Reduced API latency from **420 ms → 210 ms (−50%)**

Everything should be quantified.  
Only then does value become visible.

## Focus on What Matters

A strong weekly report should be deliverable in **three minutes verbally**.  
If it takes ten minutes to explain, it’s a speech — not a report.

Golden rule:

> **Limit yourself to 3 core contributions per week.**

Ask yourself repeatedly:
- Did this truly move the needle?
- Is the impact measurable?
- Does it align with team or company goals?

Cut everything else.  
Focus is what demonstrates value.

## Anchor Everything to OKRs

Every item in your weekly report should answer:

> Which OKR does this support?

Example:

**OKR: Increase paid conversion rate from 5% to 8%**

Weekly report entries:

- Improved payment success rate from 92% to 96%  
- Reduced payment API failure rate by 40%  

When written this way, you’re no longer “just coding.”  
You’re contributing directly to **business growth**.

## Standard Structure of a High-Quality Weekly Report

### This Week (Value-Focused)

1. **[Quantified Result #1]**
   - What was done  
   - Measurable outcome  
   - Business impact  

2. **[Quantified Result #2]**
   - What was done  
   - Measurable outcome  
   - Business impact  

3. **[Quantified Result #3]**
   - What was done  
   - Measurable outcome  
   - Business impact  

(Keep it within 3–5 items.)

---

### Next Week (Priority-Focused)

- Continue advancing OKR X  
- Deliver milestone Y  
- Complete performance optimization for module Z  
- Mitigate identified risk ABC  

Future plans must also align with OKRs — not personal interests.

## AI + Automation

Today, with the help of AI, weekly reporting systems have been significantly upgraded.

Modern enterprises have integrated weekly reporting systems with:

- Project management and bug tracking tools (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla)  
- Code repositories (commit history)  
- Meetings and instant messaging systems (notes and action items)  
- Knowledge bases (documentation and proposals)  

AI can automatically:
- Aggregate completed tasks  
- Extract bug fixes  
- Summarize meeting notes  
- Highlight code contributions  

Auto-generated weekly reports can significantly reduce manual writing time.

But here’s the most important point:

> AI can summarize actions — only you understand the core value.

Automatically generated content often contains:
- Too many trivial tasks  
- Repetitive low-value items  
- Meeting noise  
- Lengthy technical details  

Your job is to:

1. **Condense it into 3–5 core contributions**  
2. **Translate actions into measurable value**  
3. **Align everything with OKRs**  
4. **Clarify next week’s highest-priority tasks**  

AI is your assistant.  
You are the decision-maker.

## Final Principle

In big tech, visibility doesn’t come from saying more.

It comes from **proving value more clearly.**
