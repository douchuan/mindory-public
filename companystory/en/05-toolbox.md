# Inside Big Tech: The Core Capability Toolbox

Today’s companies are facing:

- Slowing growth  
- Increasing operational pressure  
- Tightened budgets and cost control  

As a result, many employers now follow an unspoken rule:

> **Select, don’t train.**

If you’ve interviewed recently, you’ve probably felt it:

- Online algorithm coding tests  
- Face-to-face system design interviews  
- Tool proficiency evaluations  

This article is about one thing: the **toolbox** you must prepare before joining.

## Theory + Practice

Theory and practice — both must be strong.

Many students graduating with a master’s degree usually already have:

- Extensive coding experience  
- Research or engineering project exposure  
- Solid problem-solving skills  

Years of structured training often make their coding ability highly polished.

But for undergraduate students, academic workload is heavy and hands-on experience is often limited. If you plan to enter the workforce directly after your bachelor’s degree, it’s best to start **systematic and deliberate practice from your freshman year**.

Specifically:

- Consistently practice coding problems  
- Learn mainstream development frameworks  
- Deploy applications yourself and build real, production-ready projects  
- Secure internships at tech companies as early as possible  

Don’t wait until your senior year to “cram at the last minute.”

Big tech interviews test more than knowledge — they test **fluency**.  
And fluency can only be built through years of **repetition**.

## Knowledge Accumulation

“Lifelong learning” is no longer a slogan — it’s a necessity.

### Learning Platforms

- Global top-tier technical talks (YouTube)  
- Structured technical courses (Bilibili, GeekTime)  

The key is not how many videos you’ve watched.

The key is whether you **build and practice**.

## Documentation: An Engineer’s Soft Power

In big tech, writing documentation and designing systems are part of engineering ability.

### Documentation Skills

You should be able to:

- Write clearly structured technical proposals  
- Create clean and practical data analysis sheets  
- Use Word efficiently  

Excellent engineers are strong communicators and writers.

### Diagramming & Prototyping Tools

- Mind mapping tools (XMind)  
- Product prototyping tools (Axure)  
- Flowchart and architecture diagram tools (Mermaid)  

If you can’t clearly draw your system, you probably don’t truly understand it.

---

## Core Technical Skills

### Programming Languages

You should be proficient in several mainstream programming languages:

- Java / Go / Python  
- TypeScript / JavaScript  
- Shell scripting  

In the AI era, Python is extremely important.  
Not knowing Python today is like being digitally illiterate.

---

### Development Frameworks

If you are comfortable with frameworks, you can contribute to projects immediately after joining.

- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue)  
- Backend frameworks (Spring Boot)  

---

### Operating Systems

You must be comfortable with:

- CentOS  
- Ubuntu  

Linux command-line skills are a hard requirement.

---

### Network Debugging Tools

Understanding network behavior separates average developers from strong engineers.

- Common network tools (ping, traceroute, netstat)  
- Packet capture tools (Wireshark, tcpdump)  

---

## AI Tools: Essential Skills in the New Era

The AI era has rewritten productivity standards.  
If you’re not using AI tools, you’re already falling behind.

But remember:

AI amplifies the strong — it does not replace fundamentals.  
Your capability determines how powerful AI becomes in your hands.

---

## Writing Code Efficiently: Tools Define Speed

### IDEs and Editors

- Professional IDEs (Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA)  
- Lightweight, high-efficiency editors (Sublime Text, Vim)  

You don’t have to master Vim, but you should have basic command-line editing skills.

---

### Version Control

You must be proficient with Git operations such as:

- Branch management  
- Rebase and merge  
- Submitting pull requests and resolving conflicts  
- Tagging releases  

---

## Debugging Skills: The Invisible Threshold of Experts

Proficiency in online debugging and diagnostic tools (such as Alibaba Arthas, eBPF) is a hallmark of senior engineers.

Anyone can write code.  
Very few can calmly diagnose and resolve production issues.

---

## DevOps Awareness

Modern engineers — even if not in operations — must understand DevOps concepts:

- Containers (Docker)  
- Cloud services and deployment platforms (Kubernetes)  
- CI/CD pipelines  

---

## Internal Enterprise Tools: Adaptability Is Mandatory

After joining a big tech company, you’ll encounter numerous internal systems:

- Proprietary dependency libraries  
- Internal CI/CD pipelines  
- Project management tools  
- Bug tracking systems  

No one will teach you from zero.

Companies assume you can **learn quickly and work independently**.  
There is usually onboarding documentation — read it carefully, ask questions, and adapt fast.

---

## Final Thoughts

The reality is straightforward:

Companies no longer pay for “potential.”  
They hire people who are already prepared.
